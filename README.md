# REACT START1

This is a starter environment for React web app. It helps you to up-and-developing quickly.

This is an evolving projecst and is primarily for my own usage, so don't be disappointed if you find rough spots or unanswered questions.

## How Easy Is It?

You can be up and running in a few minutes. 

This assumes that you already have GIT, Node.js and NPM installed on your computer and are already comfortable with basic operations of those tools.

## What This Starter Includes

* Babel — so you can code in JSX and ES6
* React Router v4
* Webpack
	* Builds — creates development and production builds
	* Serve — for developent testing
	* Watch — watches for code changes and automatically recompiles
* CSS importing — from within your React JSX documents, not index.html
